I am currently a Ph.D. Student at [Nasp, University of Milan](https://www.nasp.eu/), where I am enrolled in the program called Economic Sociology & Labour Studies, in collaboration with the Collegio Carlo Alberto in Turin. During my BA and MA, I mainly studied Political Science (at the University of Bologna and at Sciences Po Toulouse). In my PhD, I studied the interplay between misinformation, social norms and institutional trust. Here you can find my **CV** and some contacts you can use to get in touch with me. In the future, I will use this webpage to post updates about my academical career.

What am I currently working on
======
My doctoral thesis tries to make a contribution to the big question "Why do people believe in fake news?". I use five studies, with a total of more than 4200 participants to address different research gaps. Firstly, I validate a new dataset of 80 social media posts mentioning both reliable and fake news in Italy and the US. I then ask participants to three different survey experiments to judge those news after responding a series of questions designed to measure their cognitive abilities and political beliefs. This allow me to re-test proposed mechanism with a new, more realistic and validated dataset of stimuli. With the same surveys, I also explore little studied mechanisms such as institutional trust, anti-elitism and the role of social norms regarding what is appropriate to share online. The three surveys also include an experimental parts designed to test if these norms (when present) can be modified, and with what results.
