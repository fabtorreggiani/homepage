I am currently a PostDoc at the [University of Trento](https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0274822), where I am part of a research team working on a PNRR-PRIN project named ECHO-BIT. In this project, we explore whether echo chambers exist in Italian citizens' media diets using a combination of survey data and passive metering data about individuals' browsing activity and consumption of TV, radio and newspapers. 
Previously, I was a Ph.D. Student at [Nasp, University of Milan](https://www.nasp.eu/), where I was enrolled in the program called Economic Sociology & Labour Studies, in collaboration with the Collegio Carlo Alberto in Turin. In my PhD, I studied the interplay between misinformation, social norms and institutional trust. 
During my BA and MA, I studied Political Science (at the University of Bologna and at Sciences Po Toulouse). 
Here you can find my **CV** and some contacts you can use to get in touch with me. In the future, I will use this webpage to post updates about my academic career.

My doctoral thesis tries to make a contribution to the big question "Why do people believe in fake news?". I use five studies, with a total of more than 4200 participants to address different research gaps. Firstly, I validate a new dataset of 80 social media posts mentioning both reliable and fake news in Italy and the US. I then ask participants to three different survey experiments to judge those news after responding a series of questions designed to measure their cognitive abilities and political beliefs. This allow me to re-test proposed mechanism with a new, more realistic and validated dataset of stimuli. With the same surveys, I also explore little studied mechanisms such as institutional trust, anti-elitism and the role of social norms regarding what is appropriate to share online. The three surveys also include an experimental parts designed to test if these norms (when present) can be modified, and with what results.
